      <p>My name is Samantha Brown I am 15 years old. I am sophmore at Simeon Career Academy and I live on the Southside of Chicago more specifically the Engkewood Community. Throughout my life, I have been through things that most people would consider their breaking point. However, I made it my making point. The things I have been through only make me stronger and desire more for myself. I have challenged myself to graduate from Simeon Career Academy with a full academic scholarship to Northern Illinois University. Then I plan on getting a Ph.D in Philosophy. </p>
